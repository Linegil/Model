## Brief explanation

This model is a part of the thesis "Modelling activity of terrestrial insects in different water availability and temperature scenarios". \

The model takes the perspective of a generic individual female insect during the beeding season. \

With activity I mean either HIDE, FEED or SEARCH MATE.\
With decision I mean the behavioral decision of choosing one of the activities at each time step in the model.\
With state I mean internal states that describes the condition of the insect (energy and water) and external states of the environment the insect lives in (temperature and humidity). \


## The flow of running the model and descriptions of the scripts
The model is run from the main script which takes in the backwards iteration and the forwards simulation as well as parameters and functions. \
Folders and filepaths must be specified for saving decision rule, simulations and visualizations. \
Parameters can be altered in the paramers script. \

Vizualisation scripts includes code for vizualising decision rules and simulation data as well as simple stats. \
